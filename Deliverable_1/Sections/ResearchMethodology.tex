This is required for research projects and should be linked
back to the project aim and objectives. It should describe the research methods that
will be employed in the project and the research questions that will be investigated.


1. build dataset of benchmarks from my systematic benchmark framework from models\\
2. perform pruning on models\\
3. run benchmark again with pruning\\
4. make adjustments to underlaying mechanism of parameter storage\\
5. verify adjustments do not break the model\\
5. run benchmarks again\\
6. draw conclusions\\

Find baselines/benchmarks

How to perform pruneing



Look at underlaying storage mechanism of parameters in Network

 - provide some plots visualising the sparsity of the weights for the pruned matrix

perform some engineering of refactoring/altering these mechanisms

rerun systematic benchmarking framework
