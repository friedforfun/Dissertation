\section{Introduction}
\emph{\textbf{Summarising the context of the dissertation project, stating the aim and objectives of the project, identifying the problems to be solved to achieve the objectives, and sketching
the organisation of the dissertation.}}

Edge devices have never been cheaper *citation*, stuff about how IoT devices are ubiquitous

Mention how there is an increasing trend to perform computing at the Edge - real time applications + privacy\\
These devices are often equipped with some form of AI application: Photo enhancment ect. Online vs offline learning\\
Edge side inference

These models can have a huge number of parameters

\autocite{chenDeepLearningMobile2020}

Issues with limited resource computation

outline the document: We start with ..., then we cover x, y, and z ...

This dissertation is an investigation into the effect of pruning on inference latency and accuracy with 
hardware without optimisations for processing sparse matrices.

\subsection{Background}
discussing related work found in the technical literature and its relevance to your
project.

Computing at the edge

compression types:\\
pruning\\
distillation\\
Quantization\\
