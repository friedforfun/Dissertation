While the process of pruning is relatively fast, retraining the network to regain lost accuracy can very demanding. To handle this problem we separated the benchmarking system (consumer) from the pruning and retraining systems (producer), this made it easy to add new pruning and benchmarking agents to a single experiment or run multiple experiments in parallel.

When pruning begins, the producer agent requests the (initially random) pruning parameters from the Weights and Biases Project server, the producer then applies the pruning algorithm and begins retraining the model. Upon completion of retraining the model is exported into ONNX format and added to a queue for the consumer (the benchmarking agent) to benchmark and record the results, these results are then logged to weights and biases.

\subsubsection{Benchmarking}

\end{figure}


To pass the pruned and trained model to the Neural Compute stick we used OpenVino; a toolkit providing a high level \textbf{inference engine(Ensure this is defined)} API, this facilitates the process of optimizing the model for specialised hardware (in this case the NCS). 
OpenVino itself has a Benchmarking tool that we leverage to access to detailed latency and throughput metrics. A predefined set of images are selected and loaded into the NCS, the benchmarking application then runs 100 iterations by passing the same 4 images through the network and returns the mean end-to-end latency (including loading images into the NCS memory), VPU processing latency (Inference latency), and throughput in FPS.
