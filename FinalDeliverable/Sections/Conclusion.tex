\subsection{Further work}
\emph{
\begin{itemize}
	\item Suggested improvements for methodology
	\item Next steps
\end{itemize}
}

\begin{itemize}
    \item More datasets need to be tested
    \item More models should be used
    \item Layer selection should be automated
    \item how well does this system generalise?
    \item Further investigation should look at a relationship between higher accuracy models after only pruning and how they recover vs low accuracy models after pruning
    \item Why are there so few completely ruined networks before retraining compared to after retraining?
\end{itemize}


\subsection{Discussion}
\emph{
\begin{itemize}
	\item Discuss results
\end{itemize}
What were the actual latency improvements over baseline?
