\subsection{Evaluation of experimental design}
\emph{
\begin{itemize}
	\item Duration of training
	\item volume of data gathered
	\item (im)practicalities - power consumption? 
	\item limitations - single optimisation metric
	\item Criticism of methodology
\end{itemize}
}




\subsection{Evaluation of results}
\emph{
\begin{itemize}
	\item Summary of results per model/dataset
	\item Deep dive into results, detailed visualisations of accuracy \& latency tradeoffs (maybe example with poor quality sensitivity analysis vs higher quality layer selection)
	\item 
\end{itemize}
}

\textbf{Interesting observations}
\begin{itemize}
    \item The models that lost all predictive power due to overpruning were not the fastest, even when targeting only latency.
    \item The relationship between more pruning and lower latency is not as simple as you get a faster model with fewer tensors
    \item When targeting accuracy we found models with as low latency when targeting latency directly.
    \item When targeting latency we found models with as high accuracy as when targeting accuracy directly.
\end{itemize}
